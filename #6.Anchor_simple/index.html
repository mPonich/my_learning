      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for specifying how documents
        are presented to users. A document is a collection of information that
        is structured using a markup language such as HTML (HyperText Markup
        Language). CSS is a foundation technology, used today by most documents
        on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary goal of CSS is to allow separation of a document’s
        presentation characteristics (formatting) from the document’s content.
        Separating content and formatting simplifies document creation and
        maintenance, improves presentation flexibility, and allows multiple HTML
        pages to share formatting by placing formatting rules in an external
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS rules can control virtually every aspect of data formatting,
        including font, color, weight, spacing, positioning, background colors
        and images, link characteristics, and more.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="Web documents"></a>Web documents</h2>
      <p>
        A web page like the one you are reading is a document. The information
        that you see in a web page is usually structured using HTML, and the
        actual content of the page and its presentation characteristics may come
        from a variety of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your web browser requests the page, one of the sources is typically
        a CSS file containing formatting directives, or rules. The web page
        explicitly references the CSS file, in effect requesting that the CSS
        rules be applied to the page contents.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><a name="Document presentation"></a>Document presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Presenting an HTML document to a user means converting it into a form
        that humans can read and use. Browsers such as Chrome, Opera, Firefox,
        and Internet Explorer are designed to present documents visually, and
        make use of CSS rules to determine how to format the data contained in
        the HTML document to achieve that presentation.

      <p>
        Thus, a web page you see in a browser is a combination of the document’s
        data sources, with the CSS formatting rules applied. In the other
        tutorials in this section you will learn more about CSS, why it is
        important, and how to use it effectively.

      <h2><a name="Why use CSS?"></a>Why use CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS helps you to keep the informational content of a document separate
        from the details of how to display it. The details of how to display the
        document are known as its style. You keep the style separate from the
        content so that you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid duplication</li>
        <li>Make maintenance easier</li>
        <li>
          Use the same content with different styles for different purposes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your web site might have thousands of pages that look similar. Using
        CSS, you store the style information in common files that all the pages
        share. When a user displays a web page, the user’s browser loads the
        style information along with the content of the page. When a user prints
        a web page, you might provide different style information that makes the
        printed page easy to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, you use HTML to describe the content of the document, not
        its style; you use CSS to specify its style, not its content. There are
        exceptions to this rule, of course, and HTML also provides some ways to
        specify style. For example, in HTML you can use a
        <b>
          tag to make text bold, and you can specify the background colour of a
          page in its tag.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use CSS, you normally avoid using these HTML style features so
        that all your document’s style information is in one place.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="selectors"></a>Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        CSS has its own terminology to describe the CSS language. In a previous
        tutorial, you created a line in your stylesheet like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code> strong {
        color: red;
      }
    </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        In CSS terminology, this entire code section is a rule. The rule starts
        with strong, which is a selector. It selects which elements in the DOM
        the rule applies to.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The part inside the braces is the declaration.</li>
        <li>The keyword color is a property, and red is a value.</li>
        <li>
          The semicolon after the property-value pair separates it from other
          property-value pairs in the same declaration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This guide refers to a selector like strong as a tag selector; you will
        also see it commonly referred to as an element selector. The CSS
        Specification refers to it as a type selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to tag names, you can use attribute values in selectors.
        This allows your rules to be more specific. Two attributes, class and
        id, have special status for CSS.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><a name="Class selectors"></a> Class selectors</h2>
      <p>
        Use the class attribute in an element to assign the element to a named
        class. It is up to you what name you choose for the class. Multiple
        elements in a document can have the same class value.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your style sheet, type a dot (period) before the class name when you
        use it in a selector.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><a name="ID selectors"></a> ID selectors</h2>
      <p>
        Use the id attribute in an element to assign an ID to the element. It is
        up to you what name you choose for the ID. The ID name must be unique in
        the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your stylesheet, type a number sign (hash) before the ID when you use
        it in a selector.
      </p>
